I am Trond Bordewich, primarily developing mac apps. I have started this blog because I want to share what I learn about  programming and occasionally other things. I am enthusiastic about learning, actually I love learning. I also like to take on new challanges. I have been thinking about starting a blog for some time, and now I finally got around and created one.

I hope to share information that will interest you, and hopfully it might come in handy.  I plan to blog about things concerning Swift, iOS, OSX, perhaps Haskell and Python, build automation, and other things that cross my path.

Feel free to contact me on twitter or leave a comment here. 

Enjoy.
