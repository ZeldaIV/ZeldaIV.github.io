## HI!

My name is Trond Bordewich. I love learning new things. One of the things that motivates me to learn, is sharing what I discover. My experience comes from several different areas; Industrial automation with robots, in-house application development, and apps for OSX, among other things.

This blog will have a strong emphasis on OSX and iOS development. But as I am always curious about new things, there will occasionally be posts about other subjects. 

When not programming I love the outdoors. So I am often seen running/skiing/biking in the woods in my hometown Trondheim. Sometimes I climb indoor or in the mountain. I also love spending time with my wife Inger and our two daugthers, Mathilde and Marie.  

My goal for this blog is to share what I learn, and hopefully you will learn something too.
